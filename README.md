# Titanic_Competition
This repository contains the code and resources for the Titanic Survival Prediction competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this competition is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the competition page (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster).

# The dataset consists of two CSV files:

train.csv: This file contains the training data, including the features and the corresponding survival status of passengers.
test.csv: This file contains the test data, including the features for which you need to predict the survival status.

# Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

# Results
The final predictions are stored in the Titanic_Kaggle_Competition.csv file. Each row corresponds to a passenger in the test dataset and contains the passenger ID and the predicted survival status (0 - Did not survive, 1 - Survived).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a logistic regression model to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes data exploration, data cleaning, and model training steps.
